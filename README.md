Face recognition using Facenet Model

In this Project we are able to recognize the trained faces in real-time using laptop/PC webcam.

An Overview of Project:-

=> Downloading the Facenet Model and making it ready to use. 

=> Capturing the image/video in which faces should be recognized.

=> Apply Face Detection on the frame/image using Haar Caascade/dlib(Here dlib is used).

=> Extracting features of each face using Facenet model.

=> Recognizing the face using various technique,threshold values(We should be able to correctly recognize the face and also should be able recognize whether the face is of stranger)
